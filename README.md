## Example Next-page Selectors

Make sure all your pages contain a 'next' link. Tools like Docusaurus and GitBook do this by default, but you'll have to do that manually for Notion.

- Docusaurus <br/>
  `NEXT_PAGE_SELECTOR=".pagination-nav__link.pagination-nav__link--next"`
- Notion (provided that you've added a 'next' link to each page)<br/>
  `NEXT_PAGE_SELECTOR='.notion-page-content div a:last-of-type[href^="/"]:not([href*="#"])'`
- GitBook (causes a timeout for some reason, so broken for now)<br/>
  `NEXT_PAGE_SELECTOR='[data-testid="page.desktopTableOfContents"] + div a:last-child[href^="/"]'`
